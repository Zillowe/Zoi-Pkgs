description: How Zoi uses opt-in telemetry to improve the application.
---

At Zoi, we are committed to protecting your privacy while also working to improve our application. To achieve this, we use an opt-in telemetry system that collects a minimal amount of anonymous data. This data helps us understand which packages are popular and which platforms are most commonly used, allowing us to prioritize our development efforts.

## What We Collect

When you choose to enable telemetry, Zoi sends a secure, anonymous event to our cloud-hosted PostHog instance when you perform certain actions. The data we collect is strictly limited to the following:

- **Event Type:** The action you performed. This can be one of the following:
  - `install`: A package was successfully installed.
  - `build`: A package was successfully built from source.
  - `uninstall`: A package was uninstalled.
  - `clone`: A package's source code was cloned.
  - `exec`: A package was executed without being installed.
- **A unique, anonymous client ID:** This is a randomly generated UUID that is not tied to any of your personal information.
- **Package Details:**
  - The name of the package.
  - The version of the package.
  - The package's repository, description, maintainer, and author.
- **The type of package** (e.g. `package`, `collection`, `service`).
- **Your operating system and CPU architecture** (e.g. `linux-amd64`, `windows-amd64`).
- **The version of the Zoi application you are using.**

**We do not and will never collect any personal or identifying information.** We do not track your IP address, hostname, or any other data that is not explicitly listed above.

## Why We Collect It

The data we collect helps us answer important questions that guide the development of Zoi:

- Which packages are the most popular? This helps us focus our maintenance efforts on the tools that matter most to the community.
- Which operating systems and architectures are most widely used? This informs our decisions about which platforms to prioritize for testing and binary releases.
- Are there installation errors we need to address? (Note: We only track successful installations, not failures.)

By understanding how Zoi is used, we can make it a better tool for everyone.

## How to Manage Telemetry

Telemetry in Zoi is **disabled by default**. You must explicitly opt-in to share anonymous data with us. You can manage your telemetry settings at any time using the `zoi telemetry` command.

### Check Your Status

To see whether telemetry is currently enabled or disabled, run:

```sh
zoi telemetry status
```

### Enable Telemetry

If you would like to help us improve Zoi, you can enable telemetry by running:

```sh
zoi telemetry enable
```

### Disable Telemetry

You can disable telemetry at any time. Zoi will immediately stop sending anonymous data.

```sh
zoi telemetry disable
```

We are grateful to everyone who chooses to opt-in. Your anonymous contributions are invaluable in helping us build a better universal package manager.
